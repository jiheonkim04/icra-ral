# Autonomous Until Paper Decision

Date: 2026-07-12 KST

Current campaign decision: `EPOCH_3_CYCLE_2_SCVC_KILLED_PIVOT_REQUIRED`

This is not a terminal decision.

Active governance: `reports/current_research_governance.md`

Allowed terminal decisions:

- `READY_TO_DRAFT_RAL_PAPER_PACKAGE`
- `AUTONOMOUS_CAMPAIGN_PAUSED_RESUMABLE`
- `HARD_EXTERNAL_BLOCKER`
- `SAFETY_RESOURCE_STOP`

## Corrected Epoch 1 Status

Cycle 1 `DICD-VLA` is archived as `UNDERPOWERED_STAGE_A_NON_GO_ARCHIVED`: full `1 / 10`, direct chunk-index delay `2 / 10`, no-history ablation `1 / 10`. This is a non-GO archive and the current formulation should not be rescued, but a one-episode difference at 10 episodes per policy is not a permanent scientific family kill.

Cycle 2 `FEDO-VLA` is archived as `VALID_CURRENT_FORMULATION_KILL`: faulted full `1 / 10`, static inverse gain `2 / 10`, APEX-style proxy `2 / 10`, no-feedback ablation `2 / 10`, clean frozen `4 / 10`, clean FEDO `0 / 10`. Do not revive the current formulation.

Cycle 3 `GCAP-VLA` is archived as `UNDERPOWERED_TARGET_AXIS_NON_GO_ARCHIVED`: occluded full `3 / 10`, occluded frozen `4 / 10`, Sobel edge boost `5 / 10`, no-temporal ablation `4 / 10`, clean frozen `1 / 10`, clean GCAP `5 / 10`. Do not rescue the current formulation, but do not call the broader perception-repair family dead.

## Next Action

Cycle 1 of Epoch 2, `PTC-VLA`, is archived as `STAGE_A_PERMANENT_KILL_CLEARLY_WORSE`: full PTC reached `0 / 10`, frozen SmolVLA reached `3 / 10`, the task-balanced gap was `0.30`, and the mechanism was active. Do not rescue this formulation.

Cycle 2 of Epoch 2, `SACF-VLA`, is archived as `STAGE_A_PERMANENT_KILL_CLEARLY_WORSE`: full SACF reached `0 / 10`, frozen SmolVLA reached `7 / 10`, the task-balanced gap was `0.70`, and the semantic component was active. Do not rescue this formulation.

Cycle 3 of Epoch 2, `OCFN-VLA`, is archived as `STAGE_B_PERMANENT_KILL_USEFUL_IMPROVEMENT_EXCLUDED`: expanded Stage B completed `400 / 400` total episodes with zero exceptions, `80` paired episodes per key policy, active mechanism, OCFN full `26 / 80`, zero-noise SmolVLA `27 / 80`, and paired upper confidence bound `0.0625` versus the strongest baseline. Do not rescue this formulation.

The related Epoch 2 failures have been synthesized in `reports/epoch_2_failure_synthesis.md`.

Epoch 3 Cycle 1, `CBFD-VLA`, is archived as `STAGE_A_PERMANENT_KILL_ZERO_VS_STRONG_BASELINE`: teacher acquisition passed, student training passed, Stage A completed `50 / 50` held-out episodes with zero exceptions, frozen SmolVLA reached `7 / 10`, and full CBFD reached `0 / 10` with active mechanism. Do not rescue this formulation.

Epoch 3 Cycle 2, `SCVC-VLA`, is archived as `STAGE_B_PERMANENT_KILL_USEFUL_IMPROVEMENT_EXCLUDED`: full SCVC reached `11 / 40`, shifted frozen SmolVLA reached `20 / 40`, and paired evidence versus shifted frozen was negative.
