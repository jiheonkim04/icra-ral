## Epoch 4 Cycle 3

`FANG-VLA` is selected and preregistered as an AFIL-anchored identity-preserving failure-aware action-field guidance method.

Artifacts:

- `reports/epoch_4_cycle_3_prior_mechanism_map.md`
- `reports/epoch_4_cycle_3_candidate_generation.md`
- `reports/fang_vla/researcher_proposal.md`
- `reports/fang_vla/proposal_hash.txt`
- `reports/fang_vla/reviewer_attack.md`
- `reports/fang_vla/researcher_rebuttal.md`
- `reports/fang_vla/mathematical_mechanism_audit.md`
- `reports/fang_vla/preregistration.md`
- `reports/fang_vla/prototype_protocol.md`

Development audit passed and the calibrated validation search selected `fang_c01`. The uncalibrated gate failure is preserved as a negative validation result. Stage A completed `50 / 50` episodes with all policies tied at `3 / 10`.

Stage B completed `200 / 200` episodes with zero exceptions. Full FANG reached `11 / 40`, while frozen SmolVLA reached `16 / 40`, AFIL local proxy reached `15 / 40`, nearest-success replay reached `14 / 40`, and the no-failure ablation also reached `11 / 40`. The paired full-minus-base delta was `-0.125` with CI `[-0.250, 0.000]`; full was exactly tied with the key ablation.

Final FANG decision: `STAGE_B_KILL_BASELINE_OR_ABLATION_EXPLAINS_RESULT`. Do not rescue this formulation.

## Epoch 4 Cycle 4

`EvoState-VLA` is selected and preregistered as an EvoScene/DREAM-anchored action-evolved state guidance method.

Artifacts:

- `reports/epoch_4_cycle_4_prior_mechanism_map.md`
- `reports/epoch_4_cycle_4_candidate_generation.md`
- `reports/evostate_vla/researcher_proposal.md`
- `reports/evostate_vla/proposal_hash.txt`
- `reports/evostate_vla/reviewer_attack.md`
- `reports/evostate_vla/researcher_rebuttal.md`
- `reports/evostate_vla/mathematical_mechanism_audit.md`
- `reports/evostate_vla/preregistration.md`
- `reports/evostate_vla/prototype_protocol.md`

Stage 0 development audit completed without closed-loop rollout and stopped as `AUDIT_STOP_DESIGN_FAILURE`. The full transition model improved over a constant predictor by `0.715309`, but improved only `0.024689` over an actionless model, below the preregistered `0.05` action-input improvement threshold. This means the proposed action-conditioned state mechanism is not sufficiently supported for rollout.

## Epoch 4 Cycle 5

`RAC-VLA` is selected and preregistered as a Reflective VLA-anchored action-consequence calibration method for frozen SmolVLA under controlled deployment action-channel shift.

Stage 0 development audit passed with `10769` consequence pairs, `53685` labeled examples, zero duplicate perturbation keys, full validation accuracy `0.585745`, action-only validation accuracy `0.368496`, no-consequence validation accuracy `0.374483`, and full-vs-best-baseline margin `0.211262`.

The bounded six-config validation search selected `rac_h4_a0.05`: history horizon `4`, residual alpha `0.05`, score `0.508926`, full validation accuracy `0.603250`, and full-vs-best-baseline margin `0.244397`.

Stage A completed `50 / 50` episodes with zero exceptions under the frozen hidden `x_attenuate` action-channel shift. RAC full reached `0 / 10`, frozen shifted Base reached `0 / 10`, the no-consequence ablation reached `0 / 10`, the Reflective-history proxy reached `1 / 10`, and the online diagonal inverse-gain baseline reached `1 / 10`. RAC full tied Base and the key ablation, lost by only `1 / 10` to the strongest baseline and simple baseline, and did not satisfy any permanent Stage A kill criterion.

Stage B completed `200 / 200` episodes with zero exceptions and a valid shared task/reset manifest: `200` unique `(variant, task, identity)` keys, duplicate keys `0`, `40` episodes per variant, and identical paired manifests. RAC full reached `1 / 40`; shifted Base reached `1 / 40`; the Reflective-history proxy reached `1 / 40`; the no-consequence ablation reached `2 / 40`; and the online diagonal inverse-gain simple baseline reached `2 / 40`. RAC full tied Base and the closest-prior proxy, but lost to the key ablation and simple baseline.

Final RAC decision: `STAGE_B_KILL_BASELINE_OR_ABLATION_EXPLAINS_RESULT`. Do not rescue RAC, retune `rac_h4_a0.05`, change the hidden shift, or reinterpret the closed result.

## Post-RAC Governance

The post-RAC performance-oriented governance is installed in `reports/current_research_governance.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `reports/codex_delegation_manual.md`. Future method cycles must maximize the probability of an honest paper-worthy positive result by using positive-prior anchors, usable-headroom audits, data/supervision health gates, identity-preserving integration, bounded development search, mathematical objective engineering, mechanism smoke, and frozen confirmatory tests.

## Epoch 4 Cycle 6

`MTF-VLA` is selected and preregistered as a FrameSkip and StructVLA anchored milestone-transition data-supervision method for identity-preserving SmolVLA adapter training.

Stage 0 development audit passed without training or closed-loop rollout using `reports/official_smolvla_stable_prediction_artifact.json`: `1600` development records, `1200` reserved test records not used, `40` task keys, duplicate sample keys `0`, duplicate frame keys `0`, high-low score gap `0.585702`, gripper-transition fraction `0.341875`, and adapter-init action delta p95 `0.0`.

The bounded six-config validation search selected `mtf_r20_ret100`: retained high-frame ratio `0.20`, retention coefficient `1.00`, validation score `0.643663`, `176` high train frames, and `391` base-retention train frames. The selected config and training manifest are frozen under `reports/mtf_vla/`.

Current stage: adapter training pending. Stage A must not start until disk-reloadable checkpoints exist for MTF full, no-retention ablation, FrameSkip proxy, and uniform retained-ratio LoRA.


The MTF adapter-training runner is implemented and dry-run validated in `scripts/run_mtf_vla_adapter_training.py`. The real selected-training manifest joins cleanly with the official split and stable prediction artifact: MTF full has `567` training events (`176` milestone, `391` frozen-base retention), no-retention ablation has `176`, the FrameSkip proxy has `176`, and uniform retained-ratio LoRA has `240`. Train/validation/test frame overlap is `0 / 0 / 0`; validation remains `400` frames; no training or closed-loop rollout happened in this dry run.

Current stage: adapter-training runner validated. Stage A must still not start until disk-reloadable checkpoints are trained and disk-reload verified for all four trainable policies.

Adapter training completed after the runner dry-run and a development-only FrameSkip proxy repair: all four trainable Stage A policies were trained with seed `101`, saved under `runs/mtf_vla_checkpoints/mtf_r20_ret100`, reloaded from disk, and evaluated on the `400` validation frames. Final decision: `MTF_ALL_ADAPTER_CHECKPOINTS_VERIFIED_STAGE_A_READY`. Validation action L2 means were `0.082590885` for MTF full, `0.082867367` for the no-retention ablation, `0.082553130` for the corrected FrameSkip proxy, and `0.082396918` for uniform retained-ratio LoRA. The corrected FrameSkip proxy uses `240` action-variation-selected train events and is distinct from the no-retention ablation. No closed-loop rollout happened and no confirmatory-test identities were used.

The MTF Stage A matched manifest is frozen in `reports/mtf_vla/stage_a_manifest.json` with canonical payload hash `1BB86A8060F8CD057AF984423021CA582E87661CB5157C072EF34B6F587739E3`. It contains exactly five policies (`frozen_smolvla`, `frameskip_proxy_lora`, `uniform_retained_ratio_lora`, `mtf_no_retention_ablation`, `mtf_full`), five deterministic task keys selected from the official 20-task manifest, fresh reset seeds `20261201` and `20261202`, `10` paired cases per policy, and `50` total planned episodes. `frameskip_proxy_lora` is labeled as a faithful local proxy, not an official FrameSkip reproduction.

Stage A completed `50 / 50` official LIBERO episodes with zero exceptions. Frozen SmolVLA, FrameSkip proxy, and uniform retained-ratio LoRA each reached `8 / 10`; the no-retention ablation and MTF full each reached `7 / 10`. Full MTF tied the key ablation and was only one episode behind the strongest baselines, so this is not a valid Stage A kill. The frozen adjudication is `MTF_STAGE_A_NONCATASTROPHIC_TO_STAGE_B_REQUIRED`.

The MTF Stage B matched manifest was frozen in `reports/mtf_vla/stage_b_manifest.json` with canonical payload hash `3C9D9CCF835A3B9753B81C320E9390EC9DA516514563E4850C1DC4F19ACC5743`. It used all `20` official tasks, fresh reset seeds `20261203` and `20261204`, `40` paired cases per policy, and `200` total planned episodes. The five policy identities were unchanged from Stage A.

Stage B completed `200 / 200` official LIBERO episodes with zero exceptions. Frozen SmolVLA reached `28 / 40`, the FrameSkip proxy reached `27 / 40`, uniform retained-ratio LoRA reached `29 / 40`, the no-retention ablation reached `32 / 40`, and MTF full reached `26 / 40`. Full-minus-no-retention paired delta was `-0.15` with CI `[-0.275, -0.025]`.

Final MTF decision: `MTF_STAGE_B_KILL_SIMPLE_BASELINE_EXPLAINS_METHOD`. Do not rescue MTF by retuning `mtf_r20_ret100`, changing retention, changing task/reset identities, or reinterpreting Stage B outcomes.

## Epoch 4 Cycle 7

Exactly three post-MTF candidates were generated and scored in `reports/epoch_4_cycle_7_candidate_generation.md` after building the prior mechanism map in `reports/epoch_4_cycle_7_prior_mechanism_map.md`. MTF remains archived and may not be rescued.

`DAGR-VLA` is selected as a DAM-VLA anchored dynamic arm/gripper routing method for frozen SmolVLA adaptation. Proposal hash: `BDE0EC67ACE8EC457CE6495D723EE476064F3D80946151326B11F0B5A1AFEF89`.

The selected first comparison is frozen at the design level to five policies: Base, a DAM-style static component proxy, DAGR full, a no-dynamic-route shared residual ablation, and one gripper-transition heuristic simple killer. No closed-loop rollout, training, or confirmatory-test tuning has happened for DAGR.

Reviewer B attack is complete in `reports/dagr_vla/reviewer_attack.md` with decision `REVIEWER_ATTACK_CONDITIONAL_PASS_REBUTTAL_REQUIRED`. The attack narrows novelty against DAM-VLA, requires `dam_static_component_proxy` to be labeled as a faithful transparent local proxy rather than an official DAM-VLA reproduction, forbids KL over deterministic 7D actions, and makes noncollapsed route-label health, route observability, bounded action deltas, and identity-preserving integration mandatory before rollout.

Researcher A rebuttal is complete in `reports/dagr_vla/researcher_rebuttal.md` with decision `DAGR_REBUTTAL_PASS_TO_MATHEMATICAL_AUDIT`. DAGR will not claim broad dynamic arm/gripper routing novelty; its local claim is frozen SmolVLA identity-preserving route-gated residual adaptation. No training, rollout, or confirmatory-test tuning has happened.

The DAGR mathematical audit, preregistration, and prototype protocol are frozen in `reports/dagr_vla/mathematical_mechanism_audit.md`, `reports/dagr_vla/preregistration.md`, and `reports/dagr_vla/prototype_protocol.md`.

Stage 0 development audit passed as `AUDIT_PASS_PROCEED_TO_VALIDATION_SEARCH` in `reports/dagr_vla/development_audit.json`: `1600` development records, `1200` train, `400` validation, `1200` reserved test records not used, duplicate sample keys `0`, duplicate frame keys `0`, split overlap `0 / 0 / 0`, base action validity `1.0`, validation any-route fraction `0.865`, and no hard stops. Route-probe accuracy margins over validation majority were translation `0.0375`, rotation `0.0725`, and gripper `0.26`.

The bounded six-config validation search completed as `VALIDATION_SEARCH_SELECT_CONFIG_REQUIRES_ADAPTER_TRAINING` in `reports/dagr_vla/validation_search.json`. Selected config: `dagr_a020_route_mlp`, residual alpha `0.20`, route architecture `mlp`, validation score `0.8571740870493018`, delta L2 p95 `0.008609326556324959`, clean delta L2 p95 `0.00672802422195673`, and action validity `1.0`.

DAGR policy identity training is complete in `reports/dagr_vla/policy_checkpoint_manifest.json`. Final decision: `DAGR_POLICY_IDENTITIES_VERIFIED_STAGE_A_MANIFEST_READY`. The trainable identities `dagr_full`, `dam_static_component_proxy`, and `dagr_no_dynamic_route_ablation` all disk-reload, preserve initial base passthrough, and have validation action validity `1.0`; the nontrainable `gripper_transition_heuristic` config is saved under the same checkpoint root.

Checkpoint root: `runs/dagr_vla_checkpoints/dagr_a020_route_mlp`. DAGR full validation delta L2 p95 is `0.008576558902859688`; DAM static proxy p95 is `0.016259152442216873`; no-dynamic-route ablation p95 is `0.006147781852632761`.

The DAGR Stage A matched manifest is frozen in `reports/dagr_vla/stage_a_manifest.json` with canonical payload hash `8379E47D3C3C73E21ADDD285491750E7406B8389578C0003278E5E187EA27E7B`. It contains exactly five policies (`frozen_smolvla`, `dam_static_component_proxy`, `dagr_full`, `dagr_no_dynamic_route_ablation`, `gripper_transition_heuristic`), five evenly spaced official tasks, fresh reset seeds `20261205` and `20261206`, `10` paired cases per policy, and `50` total planned episodes. `dam_static_component_proxy` remains labeled as a faithful transparent local proxy, not an official DAM-VLA reproduction.

DAGR Stage A policy preflight passed as `DAGR_STAGE_A_PREFLIGHT_PASS_READY_FOR_OFFICIAL_ROLLOUT` in `reports/dagr_vla/stage_a_preflight.json`. Five policies loaded through the official SmolVLA/LIBERO path, four checkpoint identities checksum-verified, no accidental checkpoint reuse was detected, the base policy and learned DAGR heads ran on CUDA, and the wrappers produced finite 7D actions. No rollout, training, or confirmatory-test tuning happened during preflight. Next action: launch the official DAGR Stage A rollout.

Stage A completed `50 / 50` official LIBERO episodes with zero exceptions. Frozen SmolVLA reached `8 / 10`, the gripper-transition heuristic reached `7 / 10`, DAGR full reached `6 / 10`, the no-dynamic-route ablation reached `5 / 10`, and the DAM-style static component proxy reached `2 / 10`. DAGR full beat the closest-prior proxy and key ablation but trailed Base by two episodes, which is noncatastrophic under Stage A governance. Final Stage A decision: `DAGR_STAGE_A_NONCATASTROPHIC_TO_STAGE_B_REQUIRED`. Next action: freeze the DAGR Stage B matched manifest without retuning.

The DAGR Stage B matched manifest froze all `20` official tasks, fresh reset seeds `20261207` and `20261208`, `40` paired cases per policy, `200` total planned episodes, and the unchanged five-policy comparison. No checkpoint, threshold, task, or reset was selected from Stage B outcomes.

DAGR Stage B completed `200 / 200` official LIBERO episodes with zero exceptions and no confirmatory-test tuning. Frozen SmolVLA reached `28 / 40`, the DAM-style static component proxy reached `5 / 40`, DAGR full reached `18 / 40`, the no-dynamic-route ablation reached `16 / 40`, and the gripper-transition heuristic reached `24 / 40`. Full-minus-Base paired delta was `-0.25` with CI `[-0.4, -0.1]`; full-minus-gripper paired delta was `-0.15` with CI `[-0.3, 0.0]`.

Final DAGR decision: `DAGR_STAGE_B_KILL_SIMPLE_BASELINE_EXPLAINS_METHOD`. This is a valid current-formulation kill because the simple gripper-transition heuristic and Base explain or exceed the full method. Do not rescue DAGR by retuning `dagr_a020_route_mlp`, changing route thresholds, changing task/reset identities, changing the policy list, or reinterpreting partial results.

Current decision: `DAGR_STAGE_B_KILL_SIMPLE_BASELINE_EXPLAINS_METHOD_CONTINUE_CYCLE_8`. Current stage: `epoch_4_cycle_8_candidate_search_pending`.
