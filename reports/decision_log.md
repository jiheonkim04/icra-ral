# Decision Log

## 2026-07-08: Research Reset And Target-Grounded ActionMap Scout

Decision: `NEED_ACTIONMAP_ANCHOR_REPRO_FIRST`

Reason: the only salvageable family was Target-Prior TCA reframed as Target-Grounded ActionMap / Language-Grounded Action Heatmap, but the local ActionMap substrate had not cleared mean-action, linear/L1, and cheap-MLP gates.

## 2026-07-08: ActionMap Mini-Anchor Gate

Decision: `KILL_ACTIONMAP_ANCHOR`

Reason: the bounded LIBERO/HDF5 mini-anchor produced real metrics but failed the hard gate.

Key metrics:

- dataset/split: `8` local LIBERO HDF5 demos, `deterministic_per_demo_time_holdout`
- train/eval records: `1008 / 432`
- mean-action action L2: `0.466767673`
- linear/L1 action L2: `0.812610317`
- simple MLP action L2: `0.501926707`
- ActionMap-style action L2: `0.529931357`
- oracle candidate action L2: `0.065653208`
- candidate top1: `0.018518519`
- candidate collapse: yes, unique translation/rotation/gripper bins `5 / 1 / 2`

Triggered kill criteria:

- mean-action baseline matched or beat the ActionMap-style heatmap head;
- cheap MLP action head matched or beat the ActionMap-style heatmap head;
- ActionMap-style head collapsed to too few candidates.

Consequence: do not proceed to Target-Grounded ActionMap from this local anchor result.

Interpretation: this kills the local minimal ActionMap approximation, not the official ActionMap paper. The low oracle candidate upper bound suggests candidate-space headroom, but the learned local head collapsed and did not exploit it.

## 2026-07-08: Official Anchor Required

Decision: `OFFICIAL_ANCHOR_REQUIRED`

Reason: local proxy and minimal approximations have repeatedly produced plausible auxiliary evidence while failing simple-baseline gates. No new VLA method should be started without an official anchor reproduction.

Only viable next steps:

A. Official ActionMap reproduction with official code/assets.

B. Official LIBERO-Safety/SafeManip benchmark reproduction.

C. Stop VLA method search under current constraints.

Execution boundary for this archive pass:

- experiments happened: no;
- training happened: no;
- rollout/replay happened: no;
- downloads/GPU/OpenVLA-OFT happened: no / no / no;
- Target-Grounded ActionMap implementation happened: no;
- new method implementation happened: no.
