# Risk Register

## Missing SmolVLA Checkpoint Files

Risk: `C:\assets\checkpoints\smolvla` exists but lacks config/tokenizer/weights files.

Impact: Blocks adapter-smoke readiness.

Mitigation: Follow `reports/smolvla_manual_acquisition_checklist.md`, place real checkpoint files manually, or use the explicitly approved SmolVLA-only acquisition source `lerobot/smolvla_base`, then rerun readiness checks.

## Wrong Checkpoint Source

Risk: Accidentally downloading from an unapproved mirror, private fork, OpenVLA-OFT repository, dataset repository, or unrelated Hugging Face model.

Impact: Invalid readiness state, unexpected file formats, accidental large downloads, or policy drift into unapproved assets.

Mitigation: The approved SmolVLA source is only `lerobot/smolvla_base`. Stop if login/token access is required, if the source redirects to an ambiguous asset, or if the command attempts OpenVLA-OFT, LIBERO, RoboSuite, RoboCasa, dataset, GPU, training, rollout, heavy import, or inference behavior.

## External Tokenizer Dependency

Risk: The acquired `lerobot/smolvla_base` files reference `HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM2-500M-Video-Instruct` for tokenizer/model support, but the current acquisition approval only covered `lerobot/smolvla_base`.

Impact: Config and weights can be present while `ready_for_smolvla_adapter_smoke` remains false because repo-local tokenizer files are absent.

Mitigation: Do not silently download the referenced external source. Require a separate explicit approval or update the readiness checker only after confirming the true SmolVLA load contract without heavy imports or model inference.

## Manual Confirmation Drift

Risk: Codex may waste turns asking the user to confirm routine state that can be checked automatically.

Impact: Slower progress, stale context, and avoidable human coordination overhead.

Mitigation: Follow the self-check gate policy in `reports/codex_delegation_manual.md`. Codex should run existing checkers, branch behavior on checker output, update state docs when useful, and ask only at dangerous gates.

## Windows / CUDA / PyTorch Compatibility

Risk: Local Windows environment may have CUDA or PyTorch compatibility issues, especially with newer RTX 5080 hardware.

Impact: Heavy imports or future GPU inference may fail even if file checks pass.

Mitigation: Keep current checks lightweight. Require explicit approval before heavy import or GPU inference. Prefer WSL2/Linux for simulator or heavier training work.

## RTX 5080 16GB VRAM

Risk: 16GB VRAM may be insufficient for larger VLA models, large heatmaps, full-resolution voxel heads, or non-quantized baselines.

Impact: OOM during future load-only smoke, feature caching, or pilots.

Mitigation: SmolVLA-first, frozen/head-only defaults, low-resolution heatmaps, batch size 1, memory estimates, and optional LoRA/QLoRA only with explicit config.

## 24GB System RAM

Risk: System RAM can become a bottleneck during dataset loading, simulator setup, or feature caching.

Impact: Slowdowns, crashes, or failed preprocessing.

Mitigation: tiny subsets, streaming/cached features, no full dataset sweeps locally, and cloud/remote handoff for larger runs.

## OpenVLA-OFT OOM

Risk: OpenVLA-OFT large work may exceed local VRAM/RAM.

Impact: OOM or unstable local machine.

Mitigation: Keep large local OpenVLA-OFT forbidden. Use only separately approved frozen/load smoke locally; move paper-grade baseline work to larger GPU resources.

## Simulator / WSL2 Risk

Risk: LIBERO/RoboSuite/simulator stack may not work reliably on native Windows.

Impact: Rollout metrics blocked.

Mitigation: Treat Windows as planning/readiness path. Use WSL2/Linux checks before simulator work. Do not run rollouts until simulator paths and checks pass.

## Baseline Reproducibility

Risk: ActionMap, native VLA, OpenVLA-OFT, and augmentation baselines may differ from published settings.

Impact: Weak or non-comparable paper claims.

Mitigation: Track configs, compute budgets, trainable parameters, latency, VRAM, and exact baseline scope. Avoid SOTA claims without strong baseline reproduction.

## SOTA Claim Risk

Risk: Overclaiming state-of-the-art from a low-compute or offline-only pilot.

Impact: Paper rejection or misleading results.

Mitigation: Restrict claims to low-compute target-conditioned action decoding/counterfactual robustness. Require ActionMap/OpenVLA-OFT-level baselines before stronger claims.

## Custom Benchmark Risk

Risk: Improvements may only hold on a custom counterfactual split.

Impact: Poor generality.

Mitigation: Include standard LIBERO-style subsets, counterfactual target-swap or LIBERO-CF-style splits, nuisance/paraphrase checks, and later simulator rollouts.

## Privileged Inference Risk

Risk: Accidentally using simulator state or labels at default inference.

Impact: Invalid method comparison.

Mitigation: Keep default inference free of privileged state. Use simulator labels only for supervision, metrics, or explicit oracle ablations.
